Someone asked to provide examples for Flutter PWAs.\n\n# Here is my full post\n\n## I have half dozens of Flutter web apps as examples \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDCAA\uD83D\uDC47 :)\n\nI've been the Flutter Web user from the very first day they announced it as a \"one more thing\" at their first conference.\n\nI immediately compiled my interactive fiction runner & editor for the web and it all worked from the very beginning.\n\n**Here is up to date version of my first flutter web app (interactive fiction runner&editor)**\n\n[https://locadeserta.com/game/?lang=en#/](https://locadeserta.com/game/?lang=en#/)\n\n\n\uD83E\uDDE0 My very latest **trading game Chumaki also has a Web version** (make sure to switch to English)\n\n[https://locadeserta.com/chumaki/](https://locadeserta.com/chumaki/)\n\n\nAnd, I think, the **most \uD83E\uDD2F sophisticated ever made Flutter Web app is my previous game Loca Deserta: Sloboda**. This is a task-based city building strategy game that has multiple maps, researches, building upgrades, random events, interactive fiction embeddings, and tones of other features:\n\n(make sure to change language to EN at the top :) )\n\n[https://locadeserta.com/sloboda/#/](https://locadeserta.com/sloboda/#/)\n\n**The last game I did for fun: Hex Puzzle \uD83E\uDDE9:**\n\n[https://locadeserta.com/hex/#/](https://locadeserta.com/hex/#/)\n\n\nLinks to iOS/Android/Windows builds of the same games are all here \uD83D\uDC47\n\n[http://locadeserta.com/index\\_en.html](http://locadeserta.com/index_en.html)\n\n\n‚úç I blog about the Flutter & Game dev in articles like this:\n\n[https://dmytrogladkyi.com/#/catalog/posts/flutter\\_animate\\_interactive\\_viewer\\_as\\_map](https://dmytrogladkyi.com/#/catalog/posts/flutter_animate_interactive_viewer_as_map)\n\n\n```\n^^^ that site is also Flutter Web \uD83D\uDD78\uD83D\uDC99\n```\n\n\n## As for performance\n\nI have iPhone 11, Galaxy Tab S7, Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact, Galaxy Note 10 Lite, Galaxy S21/S21Ultra, iPad 2017, Nokia 5.2, Oukitel 10000\n\n\nOn all of these devices my games runs very smoothly, **except on Galaxy Note 10 Lite**. I think its CPU is underpowered (some mediatek...) that is why it lacks so much behind.\n\n\n\uD83D\uDC49I like to go to smartphone shops and check my online games. **I must say that in last year the new cheap devices like Meizu/Xiaomi started performing quite well when I open my games in Android Browser.** Any other devices in a range $500+ will perform well\\*. I think Snapdragon 855 is a minimum requiremenet to have 60FPS in Flutter Web.\\* Of course, sometimes there are glitches, but they are present even in \"real\" web apps done with JS and HTML. Page refresh fixes it as usual haha.\n\n\n**\uD83D\uDC51 iOS Safari is an absolute King of performance** as it was running 60FPS even back in 2018\n\n\nPer tweets from Flutter team they started giving \uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDD78 more time. I expect starting screen improvements, reduced bundle size, improvements in PWA to be merged in next stable release.\n\n\nStay tuned and Always Bet on Flutter (c) Dmytro Gladkyi",
